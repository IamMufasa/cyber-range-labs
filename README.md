# Windows 10 STIG Remediation Toolkit

This repository contains **PowerShell scripts** that enforce **DISA STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide)** requirements for Windows 10.  
Each script automates a specific STIG control and includes documentation for the vulnerability, how to check it, how to fix it, and the script implementation.  

The goal of this project is to build a **modular, repeatable hardening toolkit** for Windows 10 that demonstrates practical security automation.
