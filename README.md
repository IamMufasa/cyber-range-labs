# Windows 10 STIG Remediation Toolkit

This repository contains **PowerShell scripts** that enforce **DISA STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide)** requirements for Windows 10.  
Each STIG control is implemented as its own module, with:

- A PowerShell script (`.ps1`) to apply the fix
- A `README.md` file explaining the vulnerability discussion, check, fix, and expected output
- References to the official DISA STIG documentation

The goal of this project is to build a **modular, repeatable hardening toolkit** for Windows 10 that demonstrates practical security automation.
